# PlateDetectAI

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting vehicle number plates using a custom-trained YOLOv3 model. The model has been fine-tuned and optimized for accuracy and performance, specifically targeting number plate detection in various image conditions.

## Features
- Object Detection: Detects number plates in images of vehicles.
- Custom YOLOv3 Model: Fine-tuned and optimized for number plate detection.
- Image Preprocessing: Includes techniques like cropping, resizing, noise addition, blurring, and rotation.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes mAP@[0.50:0.95] and mAP@0.70 for performance evaluation.
- Efficient Inference: Benchmarked inference time per image for performance analysis.
